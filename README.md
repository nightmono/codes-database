# Code Database

Database system that stores [pass]codes with a limited amount of uses, made using Python and SQLite.

Test the system with codes: `test-code`, `last-code`, and `expired-code`.

Expired codes are codes with <1 uses. They are not deleted upon expiration.

## TODO

- [ ] Code metadata
- [ ] Unlimited use codes (could set uses to a very big number)
- [ ] Time expiration
